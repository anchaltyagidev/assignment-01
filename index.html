            From July till September In the monsoon season, Manali enjoys
            pleasant climatic conditions. However, the region receives
            torrential rain due to which the possibility of landslides increases
            in this season. The rainfall transfers the region into lush green
            and enhances the beauty of the hill town. This is the best time for
            budget travelers as they can avail of alluring discounts on Manali
            hotels.

            The waterfall plunges into its full glory and gushing streams look
            amazing. Although, watersports and camping remain close in the rainy
            season. Tourists can indulge in sightseeing and nature walk. It is
            recommendable to avoid trekking in the rainy season as the heavy
            rain can cause problems. The temperature hovers around 10? C to 16?
            C in the monsoon season.
